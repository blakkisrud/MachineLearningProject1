\section{Introduction} \label{section:Exercise 2}
Regression methods are applied in various different fields, ranging from cancer prediction methods \cite{SHAIKH202240}, financial risk assessment \cite{BROBY2022145} and also in climate and emission research it has found its applications \cite{ZhouYi}. In this project we are trying to apply machine learning methods onto geographic topological data, to find function representing the terrain of a certain area. First the methods of Ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge and Lasso regression will be presented and tested on a three dimensional Franke-function with a small noise. The methods will be evaluated depending depending on their complexity using the mean squared error. Furthermore, resampling techniques such as cross-validation and a bootstrap method will be used to create more available datapoints. \\
In the second step OLS will be used to fit geographic data from Kathmandu.  \\

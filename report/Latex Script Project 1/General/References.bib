abstract = {Cancer has identified a diverse condition of several various subtypes. The timely screening and course of treatment of a cancer form is now a requirement in early cancer research because it supports the medical treatment of patients. Many research teams studied the application of ML and Deep Learning methods in the field of biomedicine and bioinformatics in the classification of people with cancer across high- or low-risk categories. These techniques have therefore been used as a model for the development and treatment of cancer. As, it is important that ML instruments are capable of detecting key features from complex datasets. Many of these methods are widely used for the development of predictive models for predicating a cure for cancer, some of the methods are artificial neural networks (ANNs), supportvector machine (SVMs) and decision trees (DTs). While we can understand cancer progression with the use of ML methods, an adequate validity level is needed to take these methods into consideration in clinical practice every day. In this study, the ML & DL approaches used in cancer progression modeling are reviewed. The predictions addressed are mostly linked to specific ML, input, and data samples supervision.}

abstract = {Statistical and computational methods are being increasingly integrated into Decision Support Systems to aid management and help with strategic decisions. Researchers need to fully understand the use of such techniques in order to make predictions when using financial data. This paper therefore presents a method based literature review focused on the predictive analytics domain. The study comprehensively covers classification, regression, clustering, association and time series models. It expands existing explanatory statistical modelling into the realm of computational modelling. The methods explored enable the prediction of the future through the analysis of financial time series and cross-sectional data that is collected, stored and processed in Information Systems. The output of such models allow financial managers and risk oversight professionals to achieve better outcomes. This review brings the various predictive analytic methods in finance together under one domain.}

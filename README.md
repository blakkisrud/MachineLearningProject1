# Project 1 - FYS-STK-something - Machine Learning

TL;DR: Latex-files in the directory _report_, code in the directory src

Deadline: October 9 2023

## Style and practices

There are little time to best practices, suggestions:

* Naturally to split the analysis into Frankes function- and the other dataset
* When plotting, save temporary stuff in src/output_tmp when things are ready plot to _report/figures_
* Keep everything in one branch _or_ make a personal branch, merge-conflicts will happen but we will deal with them
* Lets follow the division-of-labor-plan below, use discord actively
* If putting functions outside the notebook, save it all to the file _src/utils_
* Lets try to follow pep-8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008 use an autoformatter if you have, I am bad at it but we should all try
* Think content in the report before we deal with compiling issues for the report, that we can fix in the end but if we all can stick to *pdflatex* that would be nice (or if others have a strong feeling for something else, this can be changed

## Division of labor-plan

* Part a: More or less done: Johan
* Part b: Needs debugging: Johan
* Part c: Needs debugging: Johan
* Part d: Freddy
* Part e: Under work: Johan
* Part f:Under work: Johan
* Part g:

* Code cleaning in the end: 
* Lead on the report:?
